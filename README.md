# Summarize-News-Articles
Summarize articles to save everyone's time.

Here, We create an app that summarizes any news article showing it's Author, publication date, summary etc.

The app contains a Graphical User Interface(GUI) to make it easier for users to interact with the app.

The user needs to just provide the url of the article they need summarized, after that the app summarizes the article, giving the user all the necessary information regarding the article, even the general sentiment using nltk.

Used Libraries:
1. NLTK
2. Textblob
3. newspaper
4. Tkinter

Note: During first run, uncomment the 'nltk.download()' to download the 'punkt' file, after that you can comment it again.
